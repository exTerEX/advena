## Detected mobile elements

### `<sample>_detected_ME.tsv`

Tab-separated table of detected ICE and IME structures. Each row represents one mobile element,
with columns for genomic coordinates, element type, boundary signature proteins, and associated
CDS.

### `<sample>_detected_ME.summary`

Human-readable summary of detection results: counts of detected ICEs, IMEs, and unclassified
elements per replicon.

### `<sample>_detected_SP_withMEIds.tsv`

Signature protein table annotated with the mobile element ID to which each protein was assigned.

## Genome annotation formats

All annotation files are gzip-compressed.

| File                          | Format  | Contents                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `<sample>_icescreen.gff.gz`   | GFF3    | ICE/IME features overlaid on the source GFF3  |
| `<sample>_icescreen.embl.gz`  | EMBL    | ICE/IME features in EMBL flat-file format     |
| `<sample>_icescreen.gb.gz`    | GenBank | ICE/IME features in GenBank flat-file format  |
| `<sample>_source.fa.gz`       | FASTA   | Genome nucleotide sequence                    |
| `<sample>_source.gff.gz`      | GFF3    | Source genome annotation (CDS features)       |

---

## Detected signature proteins

### `<sample>_detected_SP.tsv`

Final table of signature proteins after false positive removal and XerS re-annotation. Each row
is one detected signature protein with its type, locus tag, replicon, and position.

---

## Run archive

### `tmp_intermediate_files.tar.gz`

Archive of all intermediate analysis files, organised to mirror the original ICEscreen directory
structure under `results/<sample>/`. Includes BLASTP output per database, HMM scan output per
profile, filtered results, merged SP tables, FP screening results, and re-annotation files.

### `param.conf.gz`

Gzip-compressed parameter summary combining the ICEscreen detection log (search thresholds, counts
of detected elements) with the full detection mode configuration (from the ICEscreen mode YAML
file). Mirrors the `param.conf` output of the original Snakemake pipeline.

---

## Pipeline info

Nextflow execution reports written to `pipeline_info/`:

| File                              | Contents                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `execution_report_<ts>.html`      | Per-task resource usage and status          |
| `execution_timeline_<ts>.html`    | Gantt chart of task execution timing        |
| `execution_trace_<ts>.txt`        | Tab-separated task metadata                 |
| `pipeline_dag_<ts>.html`          | Directed acyclic graph of the workflow      |
